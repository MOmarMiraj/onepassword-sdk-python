## NEW

- ** and  item metadata:** Items and item overviews ****now expose attributes with their creation and last edit times**.**
- **Resolving secrets in bulk**: With the  function, the SDK is now able to resolve multiple secrets at once, improving the performance of the operation.

## IMPROVED

- **Support for new field types:** Items with  and  fields can now be created, retrieved, and edited using the 1Password SDK.
- **Item sharing for attachments and documents**: Items with files attached can now be shared.
- **Adding custom fields in sections automatically**: If a custom field has no specified section, the SDKs now automatically add the custom field to an empty section within the item, creating it if necessary.
- ** in item overviews**: The return type of  now also contains the item tags.
- **Broader item editing capabilities**: You can now use the items.put function with more item types, including those with fields that are not directly editable through the SDK, like legacy fields, or passkeys.

## FIXED

- **Improvements to resolving secret references:**
    - Archived items are no longer used for secret references.
    - When multiple sections match a section query when resolving secret references, the SDKs now look through the fields in all matching sections instead of erroring.
